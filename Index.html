  Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive hot ball of plasma,
  inflated and heated by nuclear fusion reactions at its core.<br>
  Part of this internal energy is emited from the Sun's surface as light, 
  ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, providing most of the energy for life on Earth.
